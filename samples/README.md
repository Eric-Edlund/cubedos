CubedOS Samples
===============

+ `LineRider`: A sample application using the STMF4-discovery platform to demonstrate some of
  CubedOS's abilities. Specifically the program controls a simple robot that uses optical
  sensors to follow a black line drawn on a light, concrete floor. This is an adaptation of a
  lab assignment used in the electro-mechanical program at Vermont Technical College.

+ `PingPong`: A sample application that where two modules send messages back and forth
  indefinitely. It is the "Hello, World" application of message passing! We use this to evaluate
  rough performance and as a base for other, more interesting programs.
  
+ `PubSub`: A sample application that demonstrates the Publish/Subscribe server.

+ `Tests`: This folder contains old test programs that are in the process of being reworked.

+ `STM32F4`: This folder contains a demonstration of CubedOS running on the STM32F4-discovery
  board.
