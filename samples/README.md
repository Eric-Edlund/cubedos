CubedOS Samples
===============

+ `BBB`: A sample application that runs on the BeagleBone Black. This sample demonstrates that
  CubedOS applications will run on that platform.
  
+ `LineRider`: A sample application using the STMF4DISCOVERY platform to demonstrate some of
  CubedOS's abilities. Specifically, the program controls a simple robot that uses optical
  sensors to follow a black line drawn on a light, concrete floor. This is an adaptation of a
  lab assignment used in the electro-mechanical program at Vermont Technical College.
  
+ `PingPong`: A sample application that where two modules send messages back and forth
  indefinitely. It is the "Hello, World" application of message passing! We use this to evaluate
  rough performance and as a base for other, more interesting programs.
  
+ `PubSub`: A sample application that demonstrates the Publish/Subscribe server. Not yet
  implemented. 

+ `STM32F4`: This folder contains a demonstration of CubedOS running on the STM32F4-discovery
  board.

+ `Tests`: I'm not sure what this is. I think it is just a holding area for CubedOS tests that
  need to be integrated into the GNATtest framework.
