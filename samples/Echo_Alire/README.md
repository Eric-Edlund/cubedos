Demo
====

This folder contains an Alire executable crate configuration for the CubedOS Echo demonstration program.  The Echo program consists of two modules that trade
messages back and forth (echo client/server modules). This is effectively the "Hello, World"
program of message passing systems.  For more on the Echo program, see `samples/Echo`.

This program is intended to be used with the Alire package manager. 

Setup
=====

- install [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/docs/#getting-started)
- build and run the executable using `alr run`
