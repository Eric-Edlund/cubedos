Demo
====

This folder contains a CubedOS demonstration program consisting of two modules that trade
messages back and forth (echo client/server modules). This is effectively the "Hello, World"
program of message passing systems.

This program is intended to be compiled for a conventional operating system such as Windows or
Linux. It allows one to experiment with the CubedOS system in an environment that is a little
easier to manipulate than an embedded environment.
