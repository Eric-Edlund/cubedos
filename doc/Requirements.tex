\chapter{Requirements}
\label{chapt:requirements}

In this section we detail the requirements of the various CubedOS standard modules. These
requirements are used to drive the architecture and design of the system. \pet{There are quite a
  few design-ish aspects to the description here. It might be valuable to create a better
  separation between requirements and design.}

\section{Core Requirements}
\label{sec:core-requirements}

At its heart CubedOS is a message passing microkernel. Conceptually each component of the system
is stored in a \newterm{module} consisting of one or more Ada packages arranged in a hierarchy.
Each module has a \newterm{module root package} that is the parent of the module's package
hierarchy. Modules in CubedOS are conceptually similar to processes in a conventional operating
system.

CubedOS uses modules for application code, operating system components, and device drivers.
Applications can be constructed from multiple application level modules. The system does not
distinguish between different types of modules (for example, between application modules and
device drivers). There is no specific ``kernel mode'' of execution. Any structuring beyond that
expressible using normal Ada visibility rules is entirely up to the system programmer.

For example it is possible, even if maybe not desirable, for an application module to directly
invoke functionality in a device driver. In contrast, conventional operating systems typically
do not allow this, or only allow it under very controlled circumstances.\footnote{However, such
  direct invocations may be more efficient; an important consideration for a constrained
  embedded system.}

CubedOS does distinguish between active modules and passive modules. A module is considered
active if and only if it either contains the system's main procedure or contains at least one
task. All other modules, for example containing library code, are said to be passive. CubedOS
does permit passive modules to be shared among multiple active modules, but it is not permitted
for any module, active or passive, to directly call subprograms or entries in another active
module. \pet{Ada has some pragmas in the distributed systems annex that we can perhaps use
  here.} The only way functionality in another active module can be invoked is by sending that
module a message. Passive modules play a role in CubedOS similar to that of shared libraries in
a conventional operating system.

In each module one task selected by the programmer, called the module's \newterm{server task},
is distinguished. The server task is the only task in a module that is allowed to receive
messages for that module. However, messages can be sent by any task. The following requirements
apply:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Core.SPARK}. The core system, including the core modules described in this
  document, shall be written in SPARK 2014 and proved free of the possibility of runtime error.
\item \textbf{Core.Ravenscar}. The core system, including the core modules described in this
  document, shall be written to conform with the restrictions of the Ravenscar
  profile.\footnote{This is likely implied by \textbf{Core.SPARK} anyway}.
\item \textbf{Core.Static}. Modules shall be statically allocated. All modules the system will
  ever have shall exist at deployment time. There is no dynamic loading of modules. \pet{What
    about on-the-fly software updates?}
\item \textbf{Core.UniqueID}. Each active module shall have a unique, constant ID number
  statically assigned by the application developer. CubedOS core modules (described below) shall
  have fixed, ``well known'' module ID numbers.
\item \textbf{Core.IDNumbers}. Module ID numbers shall be small integers beginning at $1$ and
  ranging up to the number of modules in the system. However, if a particular core module is not
  used, it's ID number is skipped (not reassigned).
\end{itemize}

\section{Runtime Library}
\label{sec:runtime-library}

The CubedOS runtime library is a passive module containing general purpose components of
interest to many CubedOS applications. Unlike the Ada standard library and many third party
libraries, the CubedOS runtime library is written in \SPARK\ and verified free of runtime error.
The following requirements apply:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Lib.SPARK}. The runtime library shall be written in SPARK 2014 and proved free of
  the possibility of runtime error.
\item \textbf{Lib.Tests}. Unit tests shall be provided for all library components.
\item \textbf{Lib.TaskSafety}. All library components shall be task safe in the sense that they
  can be called simultaneously from multiple tasks without error.
\item \textbf{Lib.PackageDeployment}. Only the packages actually used by an application shall
  become part of the application's executable. This means the library can contain a rich
  collection of packages without burdening applications that don't require them.
\end{itemize}

The precise library components provided is not specified here but is intended to be an open
ended set of components found useful in CubedOS applications. Example of such components
include, but are not limited to:

\begin{itemize}
\item String processing, including regular expression processing
\item Statistical processing
\item Linear algebra
\item Image processing
\item Error checking/correction
\item Communication protocol processing
\item Lightweight database support
\end{itemize}

What distinguishes runtime library material from active CubedOS modules is that none of the
runtime library components contain tasks or perform blocking operations (such as delays).
Notice, however, that some library components may wish to send messages to other active
components, such as the file server. In that case the library cannot directly receive the reply
(only an active module can receive from a mailbox), but instead must rely on the active module
using the library to forward replies into the library. This unusual organization also
distinguishes the CubedOS runtime library from most other libraries.

\section{Core Modules}
\label{sec:core-modules}

Any CubedOS based system shall contain certain \newterm{core modules} as a minimum. They always
exist and have fixed module ID numbers. Note that it is possible that some core modules will not
be required by all applications. However, their module ID numbers remain reserved. In this
section we describe these core modules.

\subsection{Message Manager}
\label{sec:message-manager}

The message manager is not a proper CubedOS module but rather forms the CubedOS kernel. It thus
does not have a module ID number. Instead the message manager holds mailboxes used to facilitate
communication between the other active modules in the system. The following requirements apply:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{MessageManager.Mailbox}. The message manager shall provide exactly one mailbox for
  each active module in the system.
\item \textbf{MessageManager.Access}. Mailboxes shall be accessed using the module ID number of
  the recipient. These ID numbers shall be globally available to all modules as statically
  initialized constants.
\item \textbf{MessageManager.Async}. Messages shall be delivered asynchronously to a module's
  mailbox. It is not necessary for a module to receive a sent message immediately.
\item \textbf{MessageManager.Sender}. Messages shall carry the module ID number of the sender to
  so that replies can be returned.
\item \textbf{MessageManager.Unstructured}. Messages shall be unstructured octet arrays. This
  allows all modules to use a common message type. However, to simplify the task of creating and
  decoding messages, CubedOS shall provide a standard data encoding/decoding facility.
\item \textbf{MessageManager.Sizes}. It shall be possible for the application developer to tune
  the size of the mailboxes (number of pending messages) and the size of the messages
  themselves.
\item \textbf{MessageManager.Priority}. Messages shall have a priority assigned to them which
  shall be, by default, the priority of the sending module.
\item \textbf{MessageManager.PrioritySet}. It shall be possible for the sender to set the
  priority of a message. In particular, it shall be possible for low priority senders to send
  high priority messages. \pet{Is this necessary or desirable?}
\item \textbf{MessageManager.FIFO}. Messages shall be received by a module in FIFO order by
  priority.
\item \textbf{MessageManager.Lost}. Messages may be lost during sending. When a module attempts
  to send to a full mailbox either a) the message shall be lost with a status return to inform
  the sender, b) the message shall be lost with no status return, or c) the oldest message with
  the same or lower priority shall be purged from the mailbox. If no such message exists in the
  last case (because they all have higher priority), the message shall be lost.
\item \textbf{MessageManager.Inheritance}. If the priority of a received message is higher than
  the execution priority of the module that receives it, the module's priority shall be
  elevated to match that of the message until |Receive| is called. At that point the module's
  priority is returned to its original value. \pet{This probably requires dynamic priorities and
    thus is in conflict with \textbf{Core.Ravenscar}.}
\end{itemize}

The message manager only provides support for asynchronous messages. No support for synchronous
messages is needed. If a synchronous send/reply is required, an explicit reply message must be
sent. This means a module may have to field other, unrelated messages while it waits for a reply
from an earlier request. This impacts the implementation of modules since they must remember the
status of all pending requests. \pet{The CubedOS library should provide some assistance with
  this.} However, it also promotes a high degree of concurrency since, in effect, no requests
are ever blocking.

\subsection{Tick Generator}
\label{sec:tick-generator}

The tick generator module provides real-time clock services. However, due to the latency and
overhead of message passing, modules that require high speed, real-time timing services may need
to use internal tasks instead. The tick generator is suitable for slow speed or non-critical
timing services. \pet{This needs to be investigated further. What can be specifically said about
  the timing of the message passing service?} The following requirements apply:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Tick.ID}. The tick generator shall have a module ID of $1$.
\item \textbf{Tick.RealTime}. The tick generator shall use a real time clock as the basis of its
  timing. Such a clock is monotonic and tracks time independently of any software activity.
\item \textbf{Tick.Periodic}. The tick generator shall provide a service whereby a module can
  request the delivery of periodic \newterm{tick messages} with a period ranging from 1 ms to 1
  hour (3,600,000 ms). The total set of tick messages generated in response to such a request is
  called a \newterm{periodic series}.
\item \textbf{Tick.Latency}. The time between when a request for a periodic series is received
  by the tick generator and when the first tick message in that series is sent shall be not more
  than one millisecond plus the latency due to message passing and processing.
\item \textbf{Tick.OneShot}. The tick generator shall provide a service whereby a module can
  request the delivery of a single tick message either after a specified delay (in the range
  from 1 ms to 1 hour), or at a specified absolute time. In this case the response message
  constitutes a \newterm{one shot series} of size one.
\item \textbf{Tick.SeriesID}. Every request shall contain a \newterm{series ID}, specified by
  the requester, that identifies a particular series.
\item \textbf{Tick.MultiSeries}. The tick generator shall support multiple series being
  delivered to the same module. For example a periodic series and a one shot series, or multiple
  periodic series with different periods, all going to the same module is supported.
\item \textbf{Tick.Message}. Tick messages shall contain a counter, starting at one, that
  indicates which message in the series it is.\footnote{The counter shall always be one in the
    case of one shot ticks.} Also tick messages shall contain the series ID number.
\item \textbf{Tick.Cancel}. The tick generator shall accept messages that cancel a
  pending\footnote{For example a one shot tick that has not yet occurred can still be canceled}
  or active series. The cancellation message shall contain the series ID. If the ID is invalid,
  there shall be no effect. \pet{Implementing cancellation could be tricky and it may not be
    important. This requirement should be considered low priority.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{File Server}
\label{sec:file-server}

Not all missions may require a file system, but many will. The core file server module provides
a simple file system interface, but the precise implementation is not specified here. It could
be implemented as a layer around a host operating system API, through a third party library, or
even as a RAM disk. The following requirements apply:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{FileServer.ID}. The file server shall have a module ID of $2$.
\item \textbf{FileServer.Names}. File names shall be limited to the FAT16 style ``8.3'' naming
  convention. This is a least common denominator naming convention that should be supportable by
  almost any underlying implementation. \pet{What should we say about the case sensitivity of
    file names?}
\item \textbf{FileServer.Size}. File sizes shall be represented using an unsigned integer with
  at least 31 bits. This supports files potentially as large as $2^{31} - 1$ bytes in size,
  depending on the underlying implementation.
\item \textbf{FileServer.FileOps}. The following operations shall be allowed on files: Open,
  Close, Read, and Write.
\item \textbf{FileServer.MultiOpen}. It shall be possible to have multiple files open at once.
  The limit on the number of simultaneously open files is not specified here but should be
  ``reasonable.''
\item \textbf{FileServer.GlobalHandles}. File handles (representing open files) shall be global
  for the entire system. In particular a handle sent from one module to another shall be usable
  by the receiving module to access a file opened by the sending module.
\item \textbf{FileServer.Modes}. It shall be possible to open files for reading, writing, and
  append mode.
\item \textbf{FileServer.Access}. It shall be possible to open files for either sequential or
  random access.
\item \textbf{FileServer.Sharing}. A file shall be openable many times simultaneously for
  reading, but any writing or appending shall require exclusive access.
\item \textbf{FileServer.Binary}. There shall be no distinction between text files and binary
  files. All data transfers shall be explicit (if a carriage return or line feed character is
  desired, it shall be written explicitly and processed explicitly on reads).
\item \textbf{FileServer.Directory}. A single directory of files shall be provided.
  Subdirectories shall not be provided.
\item \textbf{FileServer.Attributes}. In addition to its name, a file shall also have the
  following attributes: Size, Date/Time stamp when last modified. The Date/time stamp shall be
  updated whenever the file is created or written.
\item \textbf{FileServer.DirOps}. The following operations shall be allowed on directories:
  EnumerateFiles, DeleteFile, GetFileAttributes.
\end{itemize}

Roughly speaking the file server interface should provide all the usual file operations, but
with a minimum of extra functionality. The maximum size of data transfered when reading or
writing files is left unspecified. It is recommended that implementations allow transfers up to
maximally sized messages.

\pet{Do we want some kind of ``garbage collection'' of open file handles? Maybe have handles
  automatically closed if they are inactive too long?}

\section{Low Level Abstraction Layer}
\label{sec:llal}

\pet{Need to talk about the modules that interface to standard busses and other low level
  hardware resources. The idea is that ``high level'' device drivers could be written in terms
  of low level operations making it possible to port a CubedOS application to a new platform by
  only rewriting the LLAL modules.}
