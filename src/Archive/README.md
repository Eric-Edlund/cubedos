Source Archive
==============

This folder contains various source files from CubedOS that are not part of the active build,
but that we want to keep on hand for reference or easy access. While it is true that old files
can be obtained from the repository history, these are files that have a high likelihood of
needing to be retrieved quickly and easily.

The contents of this folder is likely to change dramatically over time. It may even be empty
(aside from this file, of course).

The API packages here were hand written. They are being held here until we are confident that
the XDR2OS3 generated packages are 100% satisfactory.
