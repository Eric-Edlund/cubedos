Module Map
==========

This file contains the "well known" module ID numbers for the various CubedOS core modules.
Application-specific modules should be numbered by application developers starting at the
"far" end of the mailbox array. For example, if the mailbox array is configured with a size of
16, the first application-specific module should use a module ID of 16, then 15, etc. The "gap"
between the application-specific IDs and the well-known IDs can later be closed by configuring
the mailbox size to what is precisely required.

Every application is encouraged to copy this file into their source repository and edit it to
include application-specific module ID assignments.

Core Modules

3. Publish/Subscribe Server (publish/subscribe message passing)
4. Time Server (timing services)
