
LaTeX Resources
===============

This folder contains various resources related to the use of LaTeX in the CubeSat Laboratory
documents. Specifically, global bibliographic databases used by the BibTeX tool, LaTeX style
information, formatting rules used by various journals, slide templates, and other resources are
all here.

For a quick primer on LaTeX see the
[LaTeX at VTC](http://web.vtc.edu/users/pcc09070/LaTeX/LaTeX.zip) document. The
[Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e](http://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf) is also an
excellent resource.

We recommend using [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/) for managing BibTeX databases. Note
that a text editor is technically all that is necessary but JabRef provides many useful services
most text editors do not.

We also recommend the BibTeX databases here be *copied* into their respective locations to be
used. That is, do not attempt to use these databases "from afar." This ensures that each
document using these databases can be built without interference from changes made here. Updates
made during a writing project should be copied back here for use in future documents.

The following is a list of (known) documents in this repository that use the BibTeX databases
here.
